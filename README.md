# car_price
Welcome to the car price prediction project!

This project aims to build a model that can predict the sale price of a car based on its characteristics. The model is trained on a dataset of german cars 
from autoscout24 set for public use on Kaggle.com, and makes prediction on unseen cars based on the input features.

The file car_project_report.pdf contains the final report made using The Rmd file with the same name

The file car_project.R is the script used to make the prediction and visualisation
